Some LISP utility functions I use frequently
============================================

In my local LISP setup I have been using these functions frequently.
So, I decided to put them in a package in my local-projects directory
under my quicklisp setup.  You are free to do whatever you'd like with
the code if you find it useful.  There isn't much of documentation,
you have been warned.
